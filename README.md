# Setup Develoment Environment
In “Presentation” folder, there are three web projects. 
-	“Web” – an old web front-end. Currently the demo site is http://www.accountgo.ph
-	“AccountGoWeb” – this is the future. Functionalities from the old "Web" front-end are soon transported to this project. Development under ASP.NET Core 1.0, ReactJS and MobX.
-	“Api” – ASP.NET REST API project to be consumed by “AccountGoWeb”.

AccountGoWeb/Api are development under ASP.NET Core 1.0, and requires you to install VS 2015 (Community is Ok) with Update 3 and the latest update of “Microsoft ASP.NET and Web Tools” extension.

“AccountGoWeb” use webpack so you also need to install webpack to the project. For some reason, Visual Studio 2015 "dependencies" is showing warning "Dependencies - not installed" when adding webpack to project.json. So for the time being, you need to install webpack manually. See instructions below.

1.	Install Visual 2015 (i.e. Community edition) with Update 3.
2.	Update “Microsoft ASP.NET and Web Tools” external tools. After you install VS 2015, go to "Tools->Extensions and updates" and search for “Microsoft ASP.NET and Web Tools”.
3.	Clone/Fork the latest repo here https://github.com/AccountGo/accountgo
4.	Install “Webpack”. open command prompt and go to “AccountGoWeb” folder. Type “npm install webpack”.
5.	Install "Webpack Task Runner" Visual Studio 2015 extension. Go to "Tools->Extensions and updates" and search for “Webpack Task Runner”.
6.	Open the solution file and restore all packages.

Note: You can use the database connection from the demo site. Look at the web.config ("Web") or appsettings.json ("Api") projects.

# Run the "Api" project
1. Right click on the project properties and go to Debug. Select "AccountGoApi" from the profile. This by default will run the api on "http://localhost:5000"
2. Make sure to update Config.apiUrl in "AccountGoWeb/webpack.config.js".
3. Set "accountgo" solution to "Multiple Startup Projects". Select "AccountGoWeb" and "Api".
